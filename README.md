# PopGenomics

This repository contains example scripts for common population genomics workflows.
Each script defines a few variables at the top so you can adjust paths and
output prefixes to your own dataset.

- `downstream_SNP_filtering.sh`: example filtering steps using `vcftools`.
- `haplotype_phasing_SHAPEIT.sh`: notes on phasing data with SHAPEIT.
